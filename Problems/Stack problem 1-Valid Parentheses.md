## Code
``` js

```
Code above solves the problem with obj/hash implementation

The idea breaks down to:
1. We need to iterate through the string and add/remove from the stack when there is a valid and opposite parentheses
2. there needs to be a stack to store the elements that have been seen but not partnered
3. an obj/hash will be used if the opposite parentheses match
